% We have 4 conditions (common, oddball, rare, reversal-learning). We get 4
% averages (1 for each condition), then we averade those for all
% participants 

%%We sampled [collected data] at 500 Hz. That was then transfered to
%%1000Hz. 
%Rereferencing: FP2 was the reference electrode. 20  (P8) is wrong, she wrongly
%said that before. Rereferecing to the average of the mastoids TP9 and TP10

%% 1. Create Grand Average;

cd 'C:\Users\mirar\Desktop\ProjektseminarMatlabData'
% where data is saved (folder with last preprocessing step) 

for x = 1:3
    x= string(x); 
    disp(x)

% all the subject numbers have to be entered here

GrandAverageEEG = nan(length(subjects), 4, 63, 750); %Grandaverage on 4 dimensions: subjects, conditions, channels, time 


for i = 1 : length(subjects)
    EEG = pop_loadset([strcat(num2str(subjects(i)), '_08_ICAdone.set')]);  
    % change _07_ICAdone.set to the name of the file of the last preprocessing 

 %%
    EpochNames = {}; %this list is supposed to be empty

    
    for c = 1 : length(EEG.epoch)
        if EEG.epoch(c).condition == "oddball" && EEG.epoch(c).surprise == "common" 
            EpochNames(c) = {'oddball_common'}; 
        elseif EEG.epoch(c).condition == "oddball" && EEG.epoch(c).surprise == "rare"
             EpochNames(c) = {'oddball_rare'};
        elseif EEG.epoch(c).condition == "changepoint" && EEG.epoch(c).surprise == "common"

%Number of epochs from the rare trials should be >30. Also, number of rare
%and common trials should also not differ too much in theory. Thats why we
%reduce the number of the trials in commumn 1 and 3 (the commons) to the
%number of epochs from the 2nd and 4th collumn (rare trials) - we randomly
%choose the number of rare trials from the common trials. AFterwards, we
%statistically check if the chosen ephocs are representative for the whole
%many.

%Exploratory analyses ideas: 
% Option1: Look at different ERPs, 2nd ERP analyses (different time when another stimuli is shown,
% e.g. the cue [Brain reacts differently to cue after a surprising stimuli
% has been shown]. e.g. choice [something insteresting happens when you
% make a choice in the brain). This analyses doesn't have to be fully
% hypotheses driven. Timewindow and all have to be reported ofc. 
%If we do that: make the time window that it doesn't touch any other
%process/stimulus
%option 2: Compare ERP and behavioral data. Ask Alexa for behavioral data.
%Correlate the data. [If you are surprised in the outcome, you should
%change your behavior]. [I'm in favor of this option, as be can reason this
%since Matt Nassar (2019) and colleagues did this too.] 
%We need 2. script to show Alexa that we did it correctly. 
%Option 3: any other thing we want to do. 

%For our introduction: What we do is.... [maybe a replication? maybe
%testing a simplifyed paradigma to the canon task?]
